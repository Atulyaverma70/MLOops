# MLOps
* Machine Learning Operations are set of practices that automate and simplify machine learning workflows and deployment.It is development and use of machine learning models by development operations (DevOps) teams. MLOps make the development process more reliable and productive.

* steps that are used to build ml model factory level:-
    * Understanding Problem
    * EDA- Exploratory data analysis(understand the data set in depth)
    * Data Pre processing 
    * Feature engineering
    * Feature selection
    * Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
    * Model evaluation
    * App Building
    * Deployment

* Issues with DS practice without MLOps project
    * low coding standard- Oops concept,modular coding, logging, exception etc.
    * No data Management- Data Ingestion/ Artifacts.
    * versioning- Code, data, Model
    * data Pipeline/Experiments
    * No CICD concepts
    * Scalibility & monitoring- Kubernetes, Prometheus,Grafana
    * cross team friction
